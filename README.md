# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-
Objective
Decision Tree & Random Forest 
We are going to predict once again if a passenger on the Titanic is going to survive or not using decision trees and random forests this time: 

1. Read your Titanic dataset as usual: A training set and Testing set Apply decision tree. 

2. Plot your decision tree and try to read the tree branches and conclude a prediction manually.

3. Change the decision tree parameters(change at least two parameters), 

4. Calculate the new accuracy and compare it with the previous results. 

5. Use random forest then change the number of estimators

6. Calculate the new accuracy and compare it with the previous result.
